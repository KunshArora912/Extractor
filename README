## Code Explanation

The main functionality is encapsulated in the `FileExtractorApp` class. Here's a brief overview of the methods:

- `__init__(self, root)`: Initializes the application, sets up the main window, and calls `create_widgets` to create the GUI components.
- `create_widgets(self)`: Creates and packs the buttons for selecting files, choosing the destination, and extracting files.
- `select_files(self)`: Opens a file dialog to select multiple files and stores them in `self.selected_files`.
- `select_destination(self)`: Opens a directory dialog to choose the extraction destination and stores it in `self.destination_folder`.
- `extract_files(self)`: Extracts the selected ZIP files to the chosen destination folder.

## Commented Out Code

There is a section of commented-out code for a "Delete Files" feature. This feature is currently disabled and can be enabled by uncommenting the relevant lines.
